Users who do not wish to participate in the tracking can easily delete the Google conversion tracking cookie via their internet browser under the user settings or deactivate it in principle. These users will then not be included in the conversion tracking statistics. Learn more about Google's privacy policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy?gl=en).

**Google Remarketing**<br/>
In addition, this website uses Google's program for interest-based advertising, known as Google Remarketing.

We use the Google Analytics feature to anonymize your IP address before storing or processing it. As a rule, your IP address is still shortened within the European Union/EEA and only then transferred to Google servers in the USA. The processing of your information is done as a pseudonym and we will not merge it with other personal data from you.

We use the data collected in this way for statistical purposes in order to optimize our website and offers. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR.

You can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link (http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de).

You can either prevent the storage of Google cookies directly in your browser settings yourself, or prevent the processing of your data by clicking on the following link and "opting out": https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. This will set an "opt-out cookie" that prevents the collection of your user data on this website.

You can find Google's privacy policy at the following link:https://policies.google.com/privacy?gl=en.

**Social plugins**<br/>
Social plugins (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) can collect data about your website visit and use it for networking. PaulCamper embeds social plugins from the following platforms.

**Facebook**<br/>
This website uses social plugins from the social network facebook.com ("Facebook"). Facebook is operated by Facebook Inc, 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. Detailed information about the functions of the individual plugins and their appearance can be found on the following website: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.
Those web pages of our Internet presence that contain Facebook social plugins establish a direct connection with Facebook's servers via your browser when you open them. Information is thereby transmitted to Facebook that the page of our Internet presence containing the social plugin has been accessed by you.
Insofar as you are logged into Facebook at this time, the visit to our pages as well as all of your interactions in connection with the social plugins (e.g. clicking the "Like" button, creating a comment, etc.) can be assigned to your Facebook profile and stored by Facebook. Even if you do not have a Facebook profile, it cannot be ruled out that Facebook will store your IP address.
Regarding the purpose and scope of the data collection as well as the processing and use of the data by Facebook, we refer to the Facebook privacy policy: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/. There you will also find an overview of the settings options in your personal Facebook profile to protect your privacy and your associated rights.
To prevent Facebook from collecting data through your visit to our website, log out of Facebook before visiting our site. One way to prevent Facebook from generally accessing your data on our and other websites is to disable the Facebook social plugins by using an add-on for your browser.

### 3.6 Icon links to social networks

On our website, we use small icons that refer to our website on third-party platforms (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google+). These are hyperlinks in each case, so no data is transferred from you automatically, but only when you click on the icons and a new tab opens in your browser with the website of the third-party provider.

## 4 Recipients of the data

As a matter of principle, we do not share your data with third parties. If you use our services as a landlord or tenant, we share your personal data to the extent necessary with the other party to carry out the booking. We use a web hoster for the technical provision of our platform and Google to perform usage analysis. They receive your personal data under a contract processing agreement and process your data only strictly according to our instructions.
To a certain extent, your data is also processed outside the European Union or the European Economic Area. When using the services of Google, YouTube, Zendesk and MailChimp, your data will be transferred to the extent described above to the USA and thus to a third country within the meaning of Art. 44 GDPR and processed there. All providers are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. This ensures an appropriate level of data protection.
We also work with developers located in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. These developers are not directly contracted to process your data, but they have access to our systems as part of their job. We have entered into a processing agreement and EU standard contractual clauses with all developers to ensure an adequate level of data protection.

## 5. Your rights under GDPR

If we process your data, you are a "data subject" within the meaning of the GDPR. You have the following rights: right to information, right to rectification, right to restriction of processing, right to erasure, right to information and right to data portability. In addition, you have a right of objection and a right of withdrawal. Below you will find details on the individual rights:

* the categories of personal data that are processed;
* the recipients or categories of recipients to whom your personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular in the case of recipients in third countries or international organizations;

**Right to rectification**<br/>
You have the right to correct and/or complete the data we have stored about you if this data is incorrect or incomplete. We will carry out the correction or completion without delay.

**Right to restriction of processing**<br/>
Under certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data. For this, at least one of the following conditions must be met:

* You dispute the accuracy of the personal data for a period of time that allows us to verify the accuracy of the personal data,
* The processing is unlawful and you object to the erasure of the personal data and instead request the restriction of the use of the personal data;
* We no longer need the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims; or
* You have objected to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR, as long as it has not yet been determined whether our legitimate reasons outweigh your interests.

**Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”)**<br/>
You have the right to demand that we delete your personal data immediately if we are obliged to do so. This is the case if one of the following conditions is met:

* Your personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed.
* You revoke your consent on which the processing was based pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. a or Art. 9 (2) lit. a GDPR and there is no other legal basis for the processing.

* The erasure of the personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation under Union or Member State law to which we are subject.
* Your personal data has been collected in relation to information society services offered in accordance with Art. 8 (1) GDPR.

If we have made your personal data public, and we are obliged to erase it in accordance with the aforementioned conditions, we shall take reasonable measures, including technical measures, to inform other data controllers processing the personal data that you have requested that we erase all links to or copies or replications of that personal data, taking into account the technologies and implementation costs available to us.

However, your right to erasure does not exist if the processing is necessary for the following reasons (exceptions):

* To exercise the right to freedom of expression and information;
* For compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing under Union or Member State law to which we are subject, or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us;
* for reasons of public interest in the area of public health pursuant to Art. 9 (2) lit. h and i and Art. 9 (3) GDPR;
* for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes pursuant to Art. 89 (1) GDPR, insofar as the right referred to in (1) is likely to render impossible or seriously prejudice the achievement of the purposes of such processing; or
* for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims.

**Right of Notification**<br/>
If you have exercised your right to rectify, erase or restrict the processing of your data to us, we are obliged to notify all recipients to whom we have disclosed your personal data of the rectification, erasure or restriction of the processing of your data, unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.

**Right to data portability**<br/>
You have the right, subject to the following condition, to receive the personal data you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and the right to have this data transferred to another controller:

The processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. a or Art. 9 (2) lit. a GDPR or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. b and
the processing is carried out with the help of automated procedures.

You have the right to request that we transfer your personal data directly to another controller, insofar as this is technically feasible and does not affect the freedoms and rights of other persons.

This right to data portability does not apply if the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us.

**Right to object**<br/>
You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of your personal data based on Article 6 (1) lit. e or lit. f GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
We will no longer process your personal data after an objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.

If we process your personal data for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of such marketing. This also applies to profiling, insofar as it is related to direct advertising.

If you object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes, we will no longer process it for these purposes.

You have the option, in connection with the use of information society services - notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) - to exercise your objection by means of automated procedures using technical specifications.

**Right of withdrawal**<br/>
According to Art. 7 (3) GDPR, you have the right to revoke your consent at any time. The revocation of consent does not retroactively invalidate the lawfulness of the processing.



**Right of complaint to a supervisory authority**<br/>
You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy. In particular, you can assert your right to complain in the member state of your place of residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement if you believe that the processing of your personal data violates the GDPR.
